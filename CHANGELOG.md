### Migration Guide

If you're upgrading from a previous version:

1. **Backup Current Configuration**:

   ```bash
   cp -r ~/.dotfiles ~/.dotfiles.backup
   ```

1. **Update Repository**:

   ```bash
   git pull origin main
   nix flake update
   ```

1. **Run Migration Script**:

   ```bash
   ./scripts/migrate-to-v1.sh
   ```

1. **Validate Configuration**:

   ```bash
   ./scripts/flake-check.sh
   ./scripts/test-framework.sh
   ```

### Breaking Changes
