# Custom CSS

# ReGreet supports loading CSS files to act as a custom global stylesheet. This enables one to do further customizations above what ReGreet supports through the config file.

# By default, the custom CSS file is named regreet.css, and located in the greetd configuration directory specified during compilation (/etc/greetd/ by default). To load a custom CSS stylesheet from a different location, pass the -s or --style CLI argument as follows:

# regreet --style /path/to/custom.css

# Please refer to the GTK4 docs on CSS in GTK and GTK CSS Properties to learn how to style a GTK4 app using CSS. For a general reference on CSS, please refer to the MDN web docs.
